A stable and efficient text editor was designed and implemented, written entirely in Rust, giving full play to its memory safety and concurrent performance advantages. Core functions such as modify, save, and find are implemented, and users can easily edit, save, and search text content. A flexible shortcut system has been introduced to enable users to quickly perform various file editing operations and improve work efficiency. Through reasonable architecture design and modular development, the maintainability and extensibility of the code are realized.

i use Rust package -- crossterm and errno to build the project,so you need use `cargo add crossterm` and `cargo add errno` to add the package. so enjoy it  in rust.
